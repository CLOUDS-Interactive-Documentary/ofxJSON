USING ofxJSON
============================================

- Use the openFrameworks `projectGenerator` to generate project files for your project.

OR

- Add all of the files in `ofxJSON/src` and `ofxJSON/libs/` to your project.
- Add `./ofxJSON/lib/include` to your Header Search Paths.  If you are using OSX, you can do this easily by updating your project's `Project.xcconfig` file.  See the examples for an example.

OR (linux)

- Install `sudo apt-get install libjsoncpp-dev` on your linux system.
- Add ofxJSON to the addons.make of your project.

RUNNING THE EXAMPLES
